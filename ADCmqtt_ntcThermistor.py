ADS1115 adc has 4 channels.  If any channel has a delta (current-previous) that is above the
 noise threshold or if the max Time interval exceeded then the 
 voltage from all initialized channels will be returned.
 When creating object, pass: Number of channels, noise threshold, max time interval, gain, and address.
 Will return a list with the voltage value for each channel

 Number of channels (1-4)
 To find the noise threshold set noise threshold low. Noise is in Volts
 Max time interval is used to catch drift/creep that is below the noise threshold.
 Gain options. Set the gain to capture the voltage range being measured.
  User         FS (V)
  2/3          +/- 6.144
  1            +/- 4.096
  2            +/- 2.048
  4            +/- 1.024
  8            +/- 0.512
  16           +/- 0.256

 Note you can change the I2C address from its default (0x48)
 To check the address
 $ sudo i2cdetect -y 1
 Change the address by connecting the ADDR pin to one of the following
 0x48 (1001000) ADR -> GND
 0x49 (1001001) ADR -> VDD
 0x4A (1001010) ADR -> SDA
 0x4B (1001011) ADR -> SCL
 Then update the address when creating the ads object in the HARDWARE section

MCP3008 adc has 8 channels.  If any channel has a delta (current-previous) that is above the
 noise threshold or if the max Time interval exceeded then the  voltage from all channels will be returned.
 When creating object, pass: Number of channels, Vref, noise threshold, max time interval, and CS or CE (chip select)
Â Will return a list with the voltage value for each channel
 Number of channels (1-8)
 Vref (3.3 or 5V) ** Important on RPi. If using 5V must use a voltage divider on MISO
 R2=R1(1/(Vin/Vout-1)) Vin=5V, Vout=3.3V, R1=2.4kohm
 R2=4.7kohm
 Noise threshold is in raw ADC - To find the noise threshold set initial threshold low and monitor
 Max time interval is used to catch drift/creep that is below the noise threshold.
 CS (chip select) - Uses SPI0 with GPIO 8 (CE0) or GPIO 7 (CE1)

 Requires 4 lines. SCLK, MOSI, MISO, CS
 You can enable SPI1 with a dtoverlay configured in "/boot/config.txt"
 dtoverlay=spi1-3cs
 SPI1 SCLK = GPIO 21
      MISO = GPIO 19
      MOSI = GPIO 20
      CS = GPIO 18(CE0) 17(CE1) 16(CE2)
